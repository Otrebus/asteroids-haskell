* Rename runFrame
* Be consistent on time/float
* If a polygon doesn't split, it can still chip leading to a minisplit. Good or bad?
* Combine drawduplicateAsteorids and drawduplicateObjects
* In intro::draw, put introstate inside IO
* runInroFrame / runIntro
* Consider rndFloat which is doubly instantiated in intro and game because it's deep inside the state structure
